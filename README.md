# CV-Global-Thresholding-
This project demonstrates Global Thresholding in Computer Vision using OpenCV. Itâ€™s a fundamental image processing technique used to convert grayscale images into binary images by applying a fixed threshold value across the entire image.
What is Global Thresholding?
Global Thresholding is a basic thresholding technique where a single constant threshold value is chosen for the entire image. Each pixel is compared against this value:
If the pixel value is greater than or equal to the threshold, it is set to the maximum value (usually 255).
Otherwise, it is set to 0.
This results in a binary image highlighting features of interest based on pixel intensity.
